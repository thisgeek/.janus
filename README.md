A collection of [Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) [customizations](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus/wiki/Customization).

DEPRECATED: This projects is now longer being maintained. My vim configuration no longer uses Janus. I now use my own curated set of configurations and plugins. My .vimrc owes a lot to Janus for its design, but it is venturing out on its own journey now.

If you're interested in following that journey, see my [dotfiles](https://github.com/thisgeek/dotfiles).
